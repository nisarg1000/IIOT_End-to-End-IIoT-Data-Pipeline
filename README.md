This project implements an **IIoT data pipeline** for monitoring and analyzing industrial sensor data.
A Raspberry Pi acts as the edge device, collecting readings from connected sensors via Python and sending the data to a **PostgreSQL** database.
The stored data is visualized through an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**, enabling real-time monitoring and analysis.
The system design also includes MQTT-based data transfer, lab integration with sensor HATs, and dashboard visualization for water pump and tank automation.

**Key Technologies:**

* Raspberry Pi (Sensor interface)
* PostgreSQL (Data storage)
* Python (Data pipeline logic)
* Streamlit (Visualization dashboard)
* MQTT (IoT communication protocol)
